<b>Problem</b>
		  
		  <p> Mainstream mobile interactions are focused around individual devices, with any collaboration happening via ‘the cloud’. We carried out design workshops with emergent users, revealing opportunities for novel collocated collaborative interactions among various available Android devices 
		  </p>
				
				
			
		  
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-md-12" align="justify">
				
		  <b>Motivation</b>
		  <p> In this experiment we presented Better Together – a framework for disaggregating services, splitting interaction elements over separate mobiles. 
		  This distribution supports both sharing of resources (such as screen real-estate, or mobile data); and, the scaffolding of inclusive interaction in mixed groups (e.g., regarding literacy or prior technology exposure).
		  We developed two prototypes to explore the concept, trailing the first—collocated group based shopping list making—with emergent users in South Africa and India. We deployed the second probe, which splits YouTube into its constituent parts across separate mobiles, in a longitudinal study with users in Kenya, South Africa, and India. 
		  We describe the concept and design process and report on the design’s suitability for emergent users based on our results.
		  
		  </p>
			<b>Process-</b>
<p>This work, which has been conducted over the course of a year and a half, involves a diverse mix of participatory design, in-situ idea and scenario generation, summit engagement and prototype refinement. A more detailed discussion of the participatory and summit methodologies

<b>Chameleon Phone (version 1) - </b>
 <p>Before embarking upon such an undertaking, though, we first built a technology probe to better understand the needs and desires of the contexts in which the device will be used. Our initial Chameleon Phone prototype, then,
 was an Android app that takes a photograph of the surface on which the phone is to be placed, and then allows the user to zoom and pan the image to match the underlying pattern (see Fig. 3 left). When a notification is received, a color in the image ‘glows’
 for several seconds to discreetly alert the user (see Fig. 3 right), before returning to its initial state. 
 Users can assign colors within the image to three different notification types in order to distinguish between the types of cues they might receive.

				 <b> Evaluation- </b>

<p>				  Six months after the future mobile design workshops, we carried out two further workshops with participants in Langa (Cape Town) and Dharavi (an informal settlement in Mumbai) to focus specifically on chameleon-like opportunities. We recruited 16 participants in each location (32 people in total – 15F, 17M, aged 18–50) to take part. 
				  Participants lived in communities the same as (in the case of Langa) or similar to (Dharavi) participants in the first workshops. 
				  None of the participants had taken part in the previous studies.

				  <!-- <p> To further evaluate the chameleon notion, we wanted to explore how the concept resonated with users in a more natural environment, providing further use-case scenarios and improvements to the updated prototype design.
				  With this in mind, we deployed the second version of the Chameleon Phone prototype over a period of five-weeks in each of four locations. Three of these regions were where we knew safety and security was an issue for local residents; that is, people drawn from
					Communities in Langa, South Africa; Nairobi, Kenya; and, Mumbai, India. In addition, we also deployed it to the 10 UK participants described in the previous section.

				 <b> Longitudianl Deployment </b>
<p>
We deployed the Better Together YouTube prototype in three resource-constrained locations over a period of five-weeks. Our goal was to explore how well the component disaggregation approach worked in a more natural, everyday environment, and whether participants saw value in its ability to share resources. 
We recruited 48 users from areas in and around, Mumbai, Langa and Nairobi (16 in each location). Participants from these regions took part in friendship groups of four people, with groups from a range of different social, educational and technological backgrounds. 
We specifically recruited participants from Mumbai and Langa who could be classed as “emergent,” whereas in Nairobi we selected participants who were less emergent, but still resource-constrained in terms of their internet access and disposable income. In order to be eligible to take part in the study, all participants had to own their own Android phone (i.e., we did not hand out devices). As a trade-off between participant privacy and depth of analysis, the app was set up to report each time a video was played, but no other information was automatically collected.

					2)Later, we started with creating with creating a sample screener for purpose of 
					recruting specific users for contextual inquiry as well as for usability testing.

					<div class="row" > 
					 <table style="width:100%">
					  
					  <tr>
						<th>Firstname</th>
						<th>Lastname</th>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
						<td>Age</td>
						<td>Should be between 20-60 years</td>
						
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
						<td>Cell phone they use</td>
						<td>They should have a cell phone with media/music player.</td>
					 </tr>
					 
					  <tr>
						<td>Familiarity with music/media player</td>
						<td>They should be familiar with operations of media/music player and should be competent performers</td>
					 </tr>
					 
					  <tr>
						<td>Profession</td>
						<td>User should be from low income profession such as construction workers, mess workers , watch man, cleaners etc.</td>
					 </tr>
					  <tr>
						<td>Gender</td>
						<td>Both men and women should be equal in number.</td>
					 </tr>
					
					</table> 

					</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row" >
					<p> 3) Then we came up with set of  focus questions for contextual inquiry <br>
					1. How do the users use media player? <br>
					2. What is their source of learning? <br>
					3. What are the key challenges while using media player? <br>
					4. How do they find particular contact while calling? <br>
					5. How do they use other electronic devices? <br>
					6. Which new features they look for? <br>
					</p>
					
					
					<p> 4) After this, we started building personas of users which mainly consisted of
					Background of user, nature of usage, concern while using media player and their expectation from the media player  </p>
