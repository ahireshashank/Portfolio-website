<b>Problem</b>
		  
		  <p>Many users value the ability to have quick and frequent sight of their mobiles when in public settings. However, in doing so, they expose themselves to potential risks, ranging from being targets of robbery to the more subtle social losses through being seen to be rude or inattentive to those around them.

		  <b>Inspiration and Motivation</b>
		  <p>In nature, some animals can blend into their environments to avoid being eaten or to reduce their impact on the ecosystem around them. Taking inspiration from these evolved systems we investigate the notion of chameleon approaches for mobile interaction design. 
		  Our probes were motivated, inspired and refined through extended interactions with people drawn from contexts with differing ranges of security and privacy concerns.
		  Through longitudinal deployments on users’ own devices, our prototypes show the value of the concept.
		  </p>
			<b>Process-</b>
<p>Workshop with emergent users- The future mobile design workshops, then, surfaced a wide range of designs and user needs. Building on these, we created an initial version of a Chameleon Phone which we tested insitu with participants in South Africa and India.

</p>
<!--
<b>Chameleon Phone (version 1) - </b>
 <p>Before embarking upon such an undertaking, though, we first built a technology probe to better understand the needs and desires of the contexts in which the device will be used. Our initial Chameleon Phone prototype, then,
 was an Android app that takes a photograph of the surface on which the phone is to be placed, and then allows the user to zoom and pan the image to match the underlying pattern (see Fig. 3 left). When a notification is received, a color in the image ‘glows’
 for several seconds to discreetly alert the user (see Fig. 3 right), before returning to its initial state. 
 Users can assign colors within the image to three different notification types in order to distinguish between the types of cues they might receive.

				 <b> Evaluation- </b>

<p>				  Six months after the future mobile design workshops, we carried out two further workshops with participants in Langa (Cape Town) and Dharavi (an informal settlement in Mumbai) to focus specifically on chameleon-like opportunities. We recruited 16 participants in each location (32 people in total – 15F, 17M, aged 18–50) to take part. 
				  Participants lived in communities the same as (in the case of Langa) or similar to (Dharavi) participants in the first workshops. 
				  None of the participants had taken part in the previous studies.

				<!--  <b>Deployment - </b>
				  <p> To further evaluate the chameleon notion, we wanted to explore how the concept resonated with users in a more natural environment, providing further use-case scenarios and improvements to the updated prototype design.
				  With this in mind, we deployed the second version of the Chameleon Phone prototype over a period of five-weeks in each of four locations. Three of these regions were where we knew safety and security was an issue for local residents; that is, people drawn from
					Communities in Langa, South Africa; Nairobi, Kenya; and, Mumbai, India. In addition, we also deployed it to the 10 UK participants described in the previous section.
					</p> -->
				 <b> Results: emergent users in Langa, Nairobi and Mumbai </b>
<p>The Langa, 11 out of 12 participants said they would leave their phone unattended when at home; however, this attitude was completely Reversed when in public. All participants said that they would not feel safe using their phone in public places, and that they kept their devices hidden in a pocket or a bag at all times. 
This overarching concern over device safety is reflected in the ratings given by participants (see Table 3) again confirming that visibly using mobiles in public is a major concern. In terms of notifications, 10 of 12 participants wanted to be able to discreetly see alerts, with privacy being the primary reason.
</p>
<p>
The Nairobi deployment, Security concerns were again dominant: all would leave their phone in view when at home, but 9 would keep it hidden (or even left at home) when in public. Discreetness was also seen as important, with privacy and rudeness given as the primary reasons for this. 
</p>
<p>
Mumbai participants were similarly cautious about using their phones publicly – while they would happily leave their devices in full view at home, all 15 would keep their phones in a bag or pocket when in public. They were far less concerned with discreet notifications, however. Only five participants stated that they had ever wanted to see notifications discreetly, each stating privacy as the reason.

					2)Later, we started with creating with creating a sample screener for purpose of 
					recruting specific users for contextual inquiry as well as for usability testing.

					<div class="row" > 
					 <table style="width:100%">
					  
					  <tr>
						<th>Firstname</th>
						<th>Lastname</th>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
						<td>Age</td>
						<td>Should be between 20-60 years</td>
						
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
						<td>Cell phone they use</td>
						<td>They should have a cell phone with media/music player.</td>
					 </tr>
					 
					  <tr>
						<td>Familiarity with music/media player</td>
						<td>They should be familiar with operations of media/music player and should be competent performers</td>
					 </tr>
					 
					  <tr>
						<td>Profession</td>
						<td>User should be from low income profession such as construction workers, mess workers , watch man, cleaners etc.</td>

					  <tr>
						<td>Gender</td>
						<td>Both men and women should be equal in number.</td>
					 </tr>
					
					</table> 

					</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row" >
					<p> 3) Then we came up with set of  focus questions for contextual inquiry <br>
					1. How do the users use media player? <br>
					2. What is their source of learning? <br>
					3. What are the key challenges while using media player? <br>
					4. How do they find particular contact while calling? <br>
					5. How do they use other electronic devices? <br>
					6. Which new features they look for? <br>
					</p>
					
					
					<p> 4) After this, we started building personas of users which mainly consisted of
					Background of user, nature of usage, concern while using media player and their expectation from the media player  </p>
