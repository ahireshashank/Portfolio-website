				<p><b>My Contribution- </b>Qualitative and quantitative research, Experiment design, Usability study, Data analysis</p>
				  <p><b>Problem</b></p>
				  
				<p>	Text input by the visually impaired using a touchscreen keyboard is slow and laborious. 
					While sighted people in English have published extensive work about text input, comparatively visually impaired people have reported less work about text input. 
					Virtually no research exists on Indic text input on touchscreen devices by the visually impaired. 
					Though several keyboards for Indic languages are available on Android Playstore, few are accessible by the visually impaired. 
					Particularly none of the gesture-based keyboards are accessible.

					</p> 
					
					 <b>Introduction to Study</b> <br>
		<p>	
					We developed an accessible prototype of the popular gesture-based, logically organised Hindi keyboard “Swarachakra”. 
					In this paper, we present findings from a two-part study. In the first part, we conducted a qualitative evaluation with 12 visually impaired users on Swarachakra. 
					In the second part we conducted a longitudinal, within-subject empirical study comparing the Swarachakra and Google Indic keyboard.
					At the end of the two-week long study, 10 participants had spent an average of 4 hours typing, including training and text input tasks. Our study establishes benchmark for text input speeds for Indic scripts by visually impaired users.

				 	<p><b> Swarachakra Accessible</b></P>
		  
		<p>
		  
An accessible version of Swarachakra was presented in  We prototyped this version of Swarachakra our study (Fig 4a). 
This version supports the explore-by-touch interaction, wherein the user can continuously slide his finger over the keyboard to locate the desired key as the screen reader reads out the key under the finger (Fig 4b).
 As the default Android Google TTS [21] does not provide feedback for some Indic characters, we used e-Speak TTS [20] for voice feedback. If only a consonant is desired,

	 <p>it is input by the usual lift-to-type interaction, after which the screen reader reads out the input in a second voice. 
As we want the users to be able to explore the keyboard by touch, Swarachakra Accessible does not display the chakra pop-up on the first touch. The user can activate the chakra pop-up by putting a second finger down anywhere on the screen. The chakra pops up under the second finger (Fig 4c). 
Thereafter, the user can lift the first finger. To pick one of the glyphs from the popup chakra, user slides the second finger in the direction of the desired vowel modifier (Fig 4d). As he does so, the screen reader reads out the vowel modifier under the finger. 
If the user has not found the desired vowel modifier yet, he can explore the chakra without lifting the second finger. Chakra can be dismissed without any input with a finger tap, while holding down the second finger

			<b>Google Indic</b> <br>
		<p align="justify">	Given its suitable design, we chose Google Indic as the representative of non-gesture based keyboards. It was also the only other Indic keyboard we found that was accessible. 
		Google Indic keyboard is logically organised, i.e. it uses the Devanagari script structure in its layout (Fig 2a). It has five rows of keys. It displays most of the frequently used Devanagari characters on the unshifted layer. Frequent independent vowels and corresponding vowel modifiers are in row 1 of this layer. This row shows independent vowels by default (Fig 2a).
		The consonants and frequent diacritic marks are in rows 2 to 5 in a layout that closely resembles the Devanagari script structure.

		   	 <p><b>Conclusion</b></P>
		  
		    <p align="justify">
		  Although there are papers discussing the benchmark data for sighted users in Indic scripts, this is the first study to provide benchmark speeds for text input by visually impaired in Indic scripts through an empirical study. 
		  In addition to this, it also provides comparison of gesture-based vs key based input and how gesture based keyboards can significantly increase performance in text input by visually impaired. 
		  Even after 10 sessions and about 3 hours of typing practice on each keyboard, there seems to be no evidence of saturation. 
		  Future research is needed with more sessions will be required to establish the saturation point.

<b>Chameleon Phone (version 1) - </b>
 <p>Before embarking upon such an undertaking, though, we first built a technology probe to better understand the needs and desires of the contexts in which the device will be used. Our initial Chameleon Phone prototype, then,
 was an Android app that takes a photograph of the surface on which the phone is to be placed, and then allows the user to zoom and pan the image to match the underlying pattern (see Fig. 3 left). When a notification is received, a color in the image ‘glows’
 for several seconds to discreetly alert the user (see Fig. 3 right), before returning to its initial state. 
 Users can assign colors within the image to three different notification types in order to distinguish between the types of cues they might receive.

				 <b> Evaluation- </b>

<p>				  Six months after the future mobile design workshops, we carried out two further workshops with participants in Langa (Cape Town) and Dharavi (an informal settlement in Mumbai) to focus specifically on chameleon-like opportunities. We recruited 16 participants in each location (32 people in total – 15F, 17M, aged 18–50) to take part. 
				  Participants lived in communities the same as (in the case of Langa) or similar to (Dharavi) participants in the first workshops. 
				  None of the participants had taken part in the previous studies.

					<p> 3) Then we came up with set of  focus questions for contextual inquiry <br>
					1. How do the users use media player? <br>
					2. What is their source of learning? <br>
					3. What are the key challenges while using media player? <br>
					4. How do they find particular contact while calling? <br>
					5. How do they use other electronic devices? <br>
					6. Which new features they look for? <br>
					</p>
					
					
					<p> 4) After this, we started building personas of users which mainly consisted of
					Background of user, nature of usage, concern while using media player and their expectation from the media player  </p>
