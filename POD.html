			<b>Process-</b>
<p>The APPropriate concept emerged through a multi-year design exercise, involving emergent users throughout to generate a range of concepts and prototypes.

				 <b> Participatory design workshops-</b>

<p>				 
At the start of this research, in June 2015, we carried out a series of participatory design workshops with emergent users in Bangalore, Nairobi and Cape Town, centred around a series of envisioning activities. 
A total of 49 people took part, with a wide range of ages and backgrounds represented. Activities involved participants sketching, describing and acting out the ideal mobile devices that they might own in the “far-off future”  defined as five-to-ten years ahead.
 
				   </p>
				   
				   <b> Future technology workshops-</b>

<p>				 
 During this session, participants watched the four scenario videos, discussing their benefits, drawbacks and potential problems, and then rated each idea’s usefulness, ranking the four designs in order of preference for us to focus on developing. The most highly rated design was for a device that separated the storage and networking elements of a mobile phone from
its display and interface, allowing its owner to use any other device as their own.

				<!--  <b>Deployment - </b>
				  <p> To further evaluate the chameleon notion, we wanted to explore how the concept resonated with users in a more natural environment, providing further use-case scenarios and improvements to the updated prototype design.
				  With this in mind, we deployed the second version of the Chameleon Phone prototype over a period of five-weeks in each of four locations. Three of these regions were where we knew safety and security was an issue for local residents; that is, people drawn from
					Communities in Langa, South Africa; Nairobi, Kenya; and, Mumbai, India. In addition, we also deployed it to the 10 UK participants described in the previous section.
					</p> -->
				 <b> Longitudianal Deployments</b>
<p>
It was clear after the lab studies that the functionality provided by the APPropriate prototype was highly desired, and that the system as designed would address several of the limitationsthat the emergent users we worked with saw in currentmobile devices. 
Consequently, we refined the APPropriateprototype and created a version of the Android app and accompanying hardware module that could be deployed for trials in conjunction with users’ own mobile devices. We deployed the APPropriate prototype in Cape Town and Mumbai with groups of emergent users, including several of those who originally
participated in the earlier phases of the design process

					2)Later, we started with creating with creating a sample screener for purpose of 
					recruting specific users for contextual inquiry as well as for usability testing.

					 <table style="width:100%">

					  <tr>
						<td>Age</td>
						<td>Should be between 20-60 years</td>
						
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
						<td>Cell phone they use</td>
						<td>They should have a cell phone with media/music player.</td>
					 </tr>
					 
					  <tr>
						<td>Familiarity with music/media player</td>
						<td>They should be familiar with operations of media/music player and should be competent performers</td>

						<td>Both men and women should be equal in number.</td>
					 </tr>
					
					</table> 

					</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row" >
					<p> 3) Then we came up with set of  focus questions for contextual inquiry <br>
					1. How do the users use media player? <br>
					2. What is their source of learning? <br>
					3. What are the key challenges while using media player? <br>
					4. How do they find particular contact while calling? <br>
					5. How do they use other electronic devices? <br>
					6. Which new features they look for? <br>
					</p>
					
					
					<p> 4) After this, we started building personas of users which mainly consisted of
					Background of user, nature of usage, concern while using media player and their expectation from the media player  </p>
