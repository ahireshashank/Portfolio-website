                    I have been actively participating in the programs meant for students with an underprivileged background and one such program is career guidance.  In India, the main cause being underprivileged is the socio-economic status of the student.
					These students are from a very humble background, i.e., their parents belong to a working class with modest education thereby are unable to provide any guidance to their children in the matters of professional education. 
					Such situation is responsible for dropping out of the schools even before completing HSE (12th grade). Since I strongly believe that “Education has the power to transform your lives,”  and hence to overcome such situations, I am dedicated to this cause in a best possible way.

		  <p>Sports has always played a critical role in my life. It has taught me how failure can play a constructive role in overcoming obstacles and has also helped to overcome my fears.
		  For instance, a few months back I had started learning to swim. Initially, I had many reservations like will I be able to perform strokes since it requires a moderate flexibility, also I had a phobia of water and depth.
		  It almost took a month to learn the strokes and another 20 days to get the strokes in sync. Even after so many hurdles, my grit was not allowing me to give up. After three months of continuous practice, I learned freestyle swimming technique. 
		  Currently, I have learned two more technique butterfly stroke and backstroke.
		  Swimming is one of the remarkable experience of my life which taught the importance of patience and persistence. I have been also actively participating the sports like Volleyball and Cricket.

				 <b> Evaluation- </b>

<p>				  Six months after the future mobile design workshops, we carried out two further workshops with participants in Langa (Cape Town) and Dharavi (an informal settlement in Mumbai) to focus specifically on chameleon-like opportunities. We recruited 16 participants in each location (32 people in total – 15F, 17M, aged 18–50) to take part. 
				  Participants lived in communities the same as (in the case of Langa) or similar to (Dharavi) participants in the first workshops. 
				  None of the participants had taken part in the previous studies.

				<!--  <b>Deployment - </b>
				  <p> To further evaluate the chameleon notion, we wanted to explore how the concept resonated with users in a more natural environment, providing further use-case scenarios and improvements to the updated prototype design.
				  With this in mind, we deployed the second version of the Chameleon Phone prototype over a period of five-weeks in each of four locations. Three of these regions were where we knew safety and security was an issue for local residents; that is, people drawn from
					Communities in Langa, South Africa; Nairobi, Kenya; and, Mumbai, India. In addition, we also deployed it to the 10 UK participants described in the previous section.

<p align="justify">I have been practicing this art since past 6 months. I was motivated to learn this art due to the following reasons firstly, because it is one of the oldest art form. 
Also, it gives us the full scope to apply our creative design and aesthetic skills.
 Moreover, it also helps to enhance our focus in our day-to-day activities. I am also looking forward to pursue a course on advance pottery. </p>

					2)Later, we started with creating with creating a sample screener for purpose of 
					recruting specific users for contextual inquiry as well as for usability testing.

					<div class="row" > 
					 <table style="width:100%">
					  
					  <tr>
						<th>Firstname</th>
						<th>Lastname</th>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
						<td>Age</td>
						<td>Should be between 20-60 years</td>
						
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
						<td>Cell phone they use</td>
						<td>They should have a cell phone with media/music player.</td>
					 </tr>
					 
					  <tr>
						<td>Familiarity with music/media player</td>
						<td>They should be familiar with operations of media/music player and should be competent performers</td>
					 </tr>
					 
					  <tr>
						<td>Profession</td>
						<td>User should be from low income profession such as construction workers, mess workers , watch man, cleaners etc.</td>
					 </tr>
					  <tr>
						<td>Gender</td>
						<td>Both men and women should be equal in number.</td>
					 </tr>
					
					</table> 

					</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row" >
					<p> 3) Then we came up with set of  focus questions for contextual inquiry <br>
					1. How do the users use media player? <br>
					2. What is their source of learning? <br>
					3. What are the key challenges while using media player? <br>
					4. How do they find particular contact while calling? <br>
					5. How do they use other electronic devices? <br>
					6. Which new features they look for? <br>
					</p>
					
					
					<p> 4) After this, we started building personas of users which mainly consisted of
					Background of user, nature of usage, concern while using media player and their expectation from the media player  </p>
