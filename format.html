 </div>
 
 <p><b></b></P>
				   <p>Considering growing usage of cell phones in India, Government of Indian asked us to evaluate input mechanisms for touch-screen devices
									with the objective of standardising one of them for each of 14 major languages of India. For this purpose, we propose a protocol that
									consists of various sessions like training, first-time usability and longitudinal test. The evaluation was done with school children from standards 4th to 7th. The course of the evaluation lasted 2–4 weeks 
									for each user. To help follow the protocol over this long period and to collate the data, we developed a tool for android cell phones. 
									In addition to this, we provide test corpora for Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. 
									Also, we have ensured that each corpus represents a mix of informal communication between people, popular phrases from films, songs, 
									poetry and public discourse, and formal texts from school books and literature. We tagged each phrase according to typing difficulty,
									phrase length, and memorability and age appropriateness. We evaluated the protocol through pilot tests with 206 users in Marathi,
									Gujarati, Hindi, Bengali, Odia, Assamese and Tamil. In this paper, we present the original protocol, the detailed findings from the 
									Marathi pilots, and the proposed modifications to the protocol.

		   &ensp; <b> Touch screen familiarity-</b> As user were from the age group of 8-12, so it was compulsory to develop the familiarity with touch screen. 
		  In order to develop a familiarity with touch screen user was made to play game of ‘Angry birds’. <br>
		  &ensp; <b> Training- </b> Initially, user was given training on words on set of 10 different  words. </br>
		&ensp; <b> FTU (First time Usability test)- </b> User were asked to transcribe a set of 20 similar words on his own. <br>
		&ensp; <b> LTU (Longitudinal Test) - </b>  In this phase, user was asked to complete 30 sessions each consisting of 10 phrases.<br>

<b>Chameleon Phone (version 1) - </b>
 <p>Before embarking upon such an undertaking, though, we first built a technology probe to better understand the needs and desires of the contexts in which the device will be used. Our initial Chameleon Phone prototype, then,
 was an Android app that takes a photograph of the surface on which the phone is to be placed, and then allows the user to zoom and pan the image to match the underlying pattern (see Fig. 3 left). When a notification is received, a color in the image ‘glows’
 for several seconds to discreetly alert the user (see Fig. 3 right), before returning to its initial state. 
 Users can assign colors within the image to three different notification types in order to distinguish between the types of cues they might receive.

				 <b> Evaluation- </b>

<p>				  Six months after the future mobile design workshops, we carried out two further workshops with participants in Langa (Cape Town) and Dharavi (an informal settlement in Mumbai) to focus specifically on chameleon-like opportunities. We recruited 16 participants in each location (32 people in total – 15F, 17M, aged 18–50) to take part. 
				  Participants lived in communities the same as (in the case of Langa) or similar to (Dharavi) participants in the first workshops. 
				  None of the participants had taken part in the previous studies.

				  <!-- <p> To further evaluate the chameleon notion, we wanted to explore how the concept resonated with users in a more natural environment, providing further use-case scenarios and improvements to the updated prototype design.
				  With this in mind, we deployed the second version of the Chameleon Phone prototype over a period of five-weeks in each of four locations. Three of these regions were where we knew safety and security was an issue for local residents; that is, people drawn from
					Communities in Langa, South Africa; Nairobi, Kenya; and, Mumbai, India. In addition, we also deployed it to the 10 UK participants described in the previous section.

					<div class="row" > 
					 <table style="width:100%">

					  <tr>
						<td>Cell phone they use</td>
						<td>They should have a cell phone with media/music player.</td>

					  <tr>
						<td>Familiarity with music/media player</td>
						<td>They should be familiar with operations of media/music player and should be competent performers</td>

					<div class="row" >
					<p> 3) Then we came up with set of  focus questions for contextual inquiry <br>
					1. How do the users use media player? <br>
					2. What is their source of learning? <br>
					3. What are the key challenges while using media player? <br>
					4. How do they find particular contact while calling? <br>
					5. How do they use other electronic devices? <br>
					6. Which new features they look for? <br>
					</p>
					
					
					<p> 4) After this, we started building personas of users which mainly consisted of
					Background of user, nature of usage, concern while using media player and their expectation from the media player  </p>
